	  1. Type in the greeter and driver and test them
	  2. Uncoment the line specified in greeter, run - what happens and why
	  3. See if you can figure out how to change the instance variable 
	     greeting in g1 by adding a line of code in driver 
	     (if you can, help your neighbors).
	  4. Run again - are g1 and g2 greeting you differntly now? 
	     Why or why not?
	  5. What if we make the instance variable greeting private.
	     Does it change what you  did for questions 3 and 4?
